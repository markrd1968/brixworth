# Brixworth
Local Village Site

The project can be viewed at: <a href="https://silverheath.co.uk/brixworth/index.html">Click Here</a>

### CONCEPT:
I have recently moved into the village of Brixworth. Being new to the area it was a challenge to find your feet and to get to know where things are. For example: Banks, Doctors, Food shops etc.

Being IT literate, I found myself searching sources such as Google and Facebook for locations, opening times etc. Although this process worked; however, it was rather time consuming.
I wanted a different solution.

### WIREFRAME:

I produced two wireframe documents. One for a desktop and the other for mobile phone screen sizes.

  * <a href="assets/wireframes/desktop.pdf/">Desktop</a>

  * <a href="assets/wireframes/mobile.pdf/">Mobile Phone</a>


### SOLUTION:
I wanted an easy solution that anyone could access with all the necessary information in one place. Something that would be clear, concise and easy for everyone to use.

My idea was to create a village website, with links to the local services, food and drink, a localised google maps search, and finally a jobs page.

### UI/UX:
The site had to be able to be navigated by all levels of users, from beginner to advanced. In addition, all the text had to be easy read, and thought went into the layout to make the site as appealing as possible.

I also wanted the site to be viewable from all devices Mobile Phones, Tablets, Laptops etc.

I considered sorting the navigation links into alphabetical order rather than what I thought would be the most used options first leading to the least used. I finally chose to sort into an order of most used pages first etc.

The colour scheme I used was clear and traditional as was aimed at all ages of visitor.
I have also moved away from my original idea of adding lots of photos of the village as this would slow down page loading times and might distract from the information given on the site.
For the links to local resources local councils etc I have used direct links to their websites in order to maintain up to date information as these sites are likely to change on a regular basis.

I did toy of entering my own information but eventually decided on using direct links. For quick access they are listed as drop-down items on the Navigation bar.

### FEATURES:

History page containing phots and text about the history and development of the village.

Local Search page containing buttons with drop down links for a food and drink section and local services such as bin collection dates, local council and details on the country park. These are all searches I considered would be the most frequent for the area.

In addition, I have also included a google maps search for other options ATM, Fuel Stations etc.

I have also included a jobs section as I thought that if you are new into the area you could possibly be looking for employment in the local area.

Following feedback from my mentor I have also included a page about myself.

Finally I have also included a contact form to enable visitors to provide feedback etc.

* <a href="https://formspree.io/">Formspree</a>
    * The project uses Formspree – An email service.

### TESTING:

I have tested this project on the most common browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox. Testing was completed using a locally hosted web server to confirm all links and formatting were working correctly. In addition, I have tested the content using a Google Pixel 4x, Nokia, Apple iPhone and IPad, and the developer kit built into Chrome.

During my testing I have manually checked all the links and buttons for functionality and have also asked my friends and family to check out the site. They have checked for content, spelling and grammar issues and links and button functionality. Their comments and feedback are very appreciated.

I have also used Microsoft word to double check the spelling and grammar used within the project.

I have used <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">HTML Validator</a> to validate the HTML code and corrected all the major error or warning messages.

I have also uploaded the CSS file to <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS <a>

### INFLUENCES:
I have researched several town and village websites for inspiration. A number stood out my favourite being Hook Norton.  <a href="https://hook-norton.org.uk/" > Hook Norton</a>

I did like to overall look and colour scheme however I did feel that it could do with a more modern colour scheme and layout. Hence the look and feel to my site.

I have also used various projects from the GitHub repository for inspiration.

### SOURCE CODE:
The google map code has been adapted from:
Google Maps Developers Documentation Tutorials/Examples.

### PHOTOS:
The Photos used on this site have been taken by myself or have been sourced online mainly from Wikipedia.

### DIPLOYMENT:
During development I was using ATOM’s excellent editor and keeping the files backed up onto OneDrive also into a GitHub Repository.

Just before I was about to publish, I uploaded the files into AWS. I used their Beautify function to make my coding as easy to read as I could. I then pushed that coding into my GitHub repository.

I then uploaded the files onto a web server that I have leased from Siteground. The files were uploaded into a private folder so that I could do my final testing. Using various devices to test the code.

Once happy with the final result I then renamed the test folder to a more logical name. I then went about submitting the project to the Code Institute for evaluation and feedback.

In addition, I have publicised the project via Facebook and LinkedIn to the project.
